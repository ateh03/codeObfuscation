## Jamil Credit Union - Data Obfuscation Tool

A lightweight C#/.NET data anonymization and code obfuscation toolkit built for developers who take data privacy seriously. Originally created under the _Jamil Credit Union_ banner, a totally nonfictional institution, we protect your data like it’s money in the vault-- because your personally identifiable information (PII) is! 

This tool makes sensitive information vanish and business logic unreadable.

## Setup
Requirements
- .NET SDK 6.0 or later
- MySQL Server (optional for data anonymization)

Installation
Clone the repository and build the project:
- git clone https://github.com/ateh03/codeObfuscation.git  
- cd codeObfuscation  
- dotnet build

Running the Program
To execute obfuscation or anonymization, run:
- dotnet run --project codeObfuscation

## Background
This project began as a fun experiment to merge data privacy and cybersecurity. I built the JCU Suite to showcase how automation can protect data, while teaching myself C# and how to apply .NET. It started as a simple internal obfuscator for my own side projects, then evolved into a flexible demo on how data privacy tooling can be compact.
